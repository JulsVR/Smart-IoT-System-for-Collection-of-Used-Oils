# Smart IoT System of Collection of used oils (UCO's)

**Description:** Development of a smart IoT system, combining Edge+Fog+Cloud computing concepts in an architecture to manage the distributed collection of UCOs (used cooking oils) that are later directed towards recycling and biodiesel production.
Automatization of the collection of UCOs in a network of oil tanks that are spread throughout the country. Two UCO collection prototypes will be sensorized with an ESP32 microcontroller and various sensors (temperature, flow, level, turbidity) to collect some of the properties of the deposited liquids. The collected information will be processed and stored locally on a device (RasPI). The collected information is sent, via an IoT protocol (MQTT), to a Cloud server (API backend). And the collected information can be viewed on a mobile app or in a website. Each deposit will be locally classified as valid (e.g. pure UCOs) or non-valid (e.g. UCOs mixed with different percentages of water or car oil).
